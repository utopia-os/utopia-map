## Conflict Resolution Process

To address and resolve conflicts effectively, the community will follow these steps:

### Step 1: Direct Communication

If a conflict arises, the involved parties are encouraged to address the issue directly and respectfully with one another to seek resolution. This conversation should focus on the behavior or issue at hand, avoiding personal attacks or assumptions.

### Step 2: Mediation

If direct communication does not resolve the issue, either party may request mediation from a neutral community leader. The mediator will facilitate a structured conversation to help clarify misunderstandings and find common ground.

### Step 3: Formal Review

If the conflict remains unresolved, the issue will be escalated to the community leadership team for review. The leadership team will gather relevant information, including accounts from all parties involved, and make a decision based on the Code of Conduct and the communityâ€™s best interests.

### Step 4: Resolution and Follow-Up

The leadership team will communicate their decision and any actions to be taken to the involved parties. Follow-up will be conducted to ensure that the resolution is effective and that no further issues arise.
