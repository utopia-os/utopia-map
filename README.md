**UI Framework for Real-Life-Networking-Apps**

*Real change happens in real life when we meet in person and connect as local communities manifesting their ideas with the earth. When we help each other to step out of our bubbles at home and start building common infrastructure to meet human needs in harmony with Mother Earth.*

*That is why Utopia UI exists. It is a UI kit for minimalist, fast, intuitive and mobile-first map apps, as a tool for local connection and decentralised networking. We believe in maps as the perfect link between digital tools and real life action* 

*It can work with any backend or p2p database and any kind of data structure.*

## Mission 
Utopia UIs mission is to provide open source building blocks to create beautiful applications with a focus on real life impact, local communities and gamification. 

The building blocks are designed to allow different networks and communities to assemble their map and app for their specific needs and purpose.

It is the base of [Utopia Map](https://github.com/utopia-os/utopia-map) and [Utopia Game](https://github.com/utopia-os/utopia-game).

## Features
